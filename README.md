[offical github](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion)

Now With
(TechnoMancer) Added Image Prompt Utility,
(BlancDeOfficial) Added Google Drive integration, Random Seed, Friendlier User interface and made the 7GB download a one time affair,
(lukasaey) Added Random/ Custom Seed options

![Run All](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/806288700736405506/1010840674272280576/Screenshot_2022-08-21_at_10.05.52.png)

By Clicking The Run All Button, you also start the process in which google colab connects to a GPU runtime

If You get this error message, there are no free GPUs at the time and so it is recommended you Ctrl + R a million times, or more preferably you try again at another time

If It has successfully started running you will see this message within the first minute of running the colab, click Connect to Google Drive, sign in and click Accept
Google Drive Integration is vital for the colab to run as image output and model storage rely on drive

Once cell 1.5 Model Downlod Check has finished running, the colab is designed to crash, this is a feature not a bug
You will not need to rerun cells 1.1 to 1.5 again during this runtime

To Continue with the AI generation process click on the cell that says cd/content/stable-diffusion/, then follow by pressing Ctrl +  F10.
Alternatively you could click on the cell click, then click the Runtime Tab on the top left, and then Run After
